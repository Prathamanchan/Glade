<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.27 release on 07/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Schematic Create Layout dialog did not set current library to that of the current cellView.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF failed on some examples.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Invalid instance pins could cause an exception, now more gracefully handled.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: improvements to arc drawing code.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create CellView added cellName to NLPDeviceFormat property, now uses [@modelName] </p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL now supports using NLPDeviceFormat property on extraction PCells for user-defined netlist formatting.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.28 release on 21/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: File-&gt;Exit with edited cells did not cancel if 'Cancel' button clicked.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL from extracted view with parasitics reported parasitics twice if 'merge parasitics' selected.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added Cancel button to Create Instance dialog.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added defaultParams property setup for Create CellView from CellView command..</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added Cross View Check to Schematic->Check and Symbol->Check menus. Checks that each view of a
library cell has same number of pins, there are matching pin names, and pin directions match.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF was incorrectly overwriting schematic info into symbol views since last version.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.29 release on 28/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash if e.g. Create Via bindkey (v) clicked while in symbol editor.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added instName Spice prefix support for device types 'vsrc', 'isrc'.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added 'Descend Read' / 'Descend Edit' option to Descend Hierarchy dialog.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Descend Hierarchy pre-seeds view name option to current view name.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL dialog remembers last switch list name setting.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: PCell submaster names are now of the form &lt;cellName&gt;$$12345678, where the number is a hashed string result. This removes an issue where long PCell submaster names caused issues with filesystems with 256 character limits, such as Windows.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added option to open new cellView when created using library browser or File-&gt;New Cell...</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Symbol now has pins displayed in a table for easier setting of side. Pin style feature added for e.g. inverted or clock pins.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Symbol has user defined wire stub length and pin size options.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.30 release on 03/02/2018</strong></p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: vsrc/isrc instName Spice prefix support was broken in Schematic-&gt;Check.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Map table entries for schematic Layout-&gt;Map Devices could be shown multiple times. Now duplicate entries eliminated when opening a library.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Inatance dialog did not show all views of a cell sometimes.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.31 release on 09/02/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL dialog allows replacing bus delimiter characters '&lt;' and '&gt;' with alternative characters.</p>

<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Pin layout dialog simplified by merging pin name and net name into one.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug moving/copying arrays.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.32 release on 16/02/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Internal property list code streamlined.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Python function getPropList() implemented for dbObj derived classes to get a Python list of properties.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Exporting GDS2 with via objects could create multiple STRUCT definitions.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export GDS2 can now export PCell property information if desired. Import GDS2 can read this information to allow PCell info to be saved/restored via GDS2. Note that this info is exported as GDS2 properties, and may be incompatible with other GDS2 readers. It has been tested with Cadence which can read this GDS2 however use at your own risk.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.33 release on 23/02/2018</strong></p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug in Import EDIF which could give incorrect property name/values.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.34 release on 03/03/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL dialog split into 2 tabwidgets so make it easier to use on low resolution screens.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Display Options-&gt;Miscellaneous-&gt;AutoRaise now controls focus grabbing by the application under all cases. Turning it off means Glade will lose focus after e.g. export/import or other commands that display a dialog. Useful if e.g. launching another application from Glade.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Help Browser Previous/Next button icons missing.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Help Browser now displayed via F1 key.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Reading Oasis cell placements with negative angles gave incorrect results.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Setting width/height if schematic-&gt;Layout-&gt;Generate Layout value was scaled by 0.16</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a trapezoid generation bug in geometry engine</p>

Schematic views with 160 dbuPerUU and userUnits of inches are reported to 5 decimal places.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Dock windows maintain size.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Polygon using trueColour mode was not using layer colour/fill.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Chop cmd using trueColour mode was using layer colour/fill for chop rectangle rather than outline.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.49 release on 06/07/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Creating a PCell supermaster set bounding box to 5x5um unnecessarily. Now sets actual bounding box.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Generate Layout from netlist will check if subcircuits (X devices in netlist) are present. If an X device has a master cell in the library with view &quot;layout&quot; then an instance of that cell will be created in the generated layout. </p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Generate Layout from schematics will ignore an instance if it has a 'nlAction' string property with value 'ignore'</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.50 release on 18/07/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Paths of type TRUNCATE did not have bounding box calculated correctly if the first vertex was greater than the last. This could cause display issues.</p>
