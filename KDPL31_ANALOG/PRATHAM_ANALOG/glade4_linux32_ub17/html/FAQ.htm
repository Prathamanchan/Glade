  <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glade FAQ</font></h2>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why is it called Glade?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simple - Gds Lef And Def Editor. 
    Ok, so it now supports a few more formats.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should I use the OpenGL version?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're running on Windows, the answer is most likely 
yes, unless you've got a very old (pre-2000) graphics card. On Linux the situation 
    is a bit more complex but again if you've got a fairly recent 
    graphics card and have installed the vendor's drivers AND set Linux to use 3D graphics 
    acceleration, then you should be OK. ATI Linux drivers do not support 
    pbuffers on some of the older cards e.g. Radeon 9200. On Solaris, if you've 
    got an Expert-3D or Expert-3D Lite card it will work. The big advantage of 
    OpenGL is hardware accelerated graphics and support for transparency of layers. If your graphics 
    card support Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) these will be used in preference to 
    pbuffers.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I get the warning 'No pbuffer 
    support available' when opening a design</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This means your graphics card does 
    not support OpenGL pbuffers. Either turn off OpenGL (see below) or buy a better 
    graphics card.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I get an error 'pbuffer is not 
    initialized' when opening a design</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This means Glade was unable to 
    create a pbuffer for the current cellview. This may occur if the requested 
    pbuffer size is not supported by your graphics card - in which case try reducing 
    the size of the appliction window. Or it may be that you are opening several 
    cellviews, and your graphics card has run out of memory to allocate pbuffers 
    - in which case try closing one or more open cellviews.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do I turn off OpenGL?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set the environment variable GLADE_USE_OPENGL 
    to NO. On Windows, right click on My Computer and then select the 'Properties' 
    item. In the dialog choose the 'Advanced' tab, then press the 'Environment 
    Variables' button. Click 'New' on the User Variables section and enter the 
    variable name and value as above. On Linux, set in your .bashrc</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">export GLADE_USE_OPENGL=NO</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have a design kit with a Cadence 
    technology file / display resources file, can Glade read that directly?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Version 4.0.6 and later it now 
    can. Be aware that there are some limitations - it can only handle stipple 
    patterns that are 32x32, 16x16, 8x8 or 4x4 bits; other sizes are rounded up 
    to the next power of two. It may also fail to read hand-edited display.drf 
    and techfiles, so make sure you've dumped the techfile from a Cadence technology 
    library.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have a design kit with a Silicon 
    Canvas technology file / display resources file, can Glade read that directly?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Version 4.0.42 and later it 
    now can. Be aware that there are some limitations - it can only handle stipple 
    patterns that are 32x32, 16x16, 8x8 or 4x4 bits; other sizes are rounded up 
    to the next power of two. It may also fail to read hand-edited display.drf 
    and techfiles, so make sure you've dumped the techfile from a Laker technology 
    library.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why don't you support non-orthogonal 
    AREFs?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GDS2 spec is sometimes interpreted 
    as allowing non-orthogonal arrays (arrays where the row spacing and/or column 
    spacings contain both X and Y components). Cadence, who 'own' the GDS2 spec, 
    do not allow non-orthogonal arrays in their translators. So to maintain interoperability, 
    Glade does not either.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why don't you support SREF/AREF 
    magnification?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of version 4.1.2 Glade now supports 
    magnification. With some trickery this comes at no memory or runtime overhead. 
    However, it is almost never really needed and other tools may not support 
    it, so beware.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why don't you support all-angle 
    SREF/AREF placement?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people don't require it, Cadence Virtuoso does not 
support it. In theory it can be supported at no overhead but will require a lot 
of changes to the UI and careful testing. So if you really, really need it let 
    us know and it could be added to the roadmap.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why don't you support feature 
    XYZ?</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, maybe&nbsp;we don't know about it. Mail support@peardrop.co.uk and tell&nbsp;us what you 
    need. This is freeware, so nothing is promised, but your request may 
    be (a) interesting or (b) simple to implement. So feel free to suggest.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've found a bug.</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please email support@peardrop.co.uk and 
    describe the problem as accurately as you can. Again we cannot promise to 
    fix all bugs but so far all the reproducible ones that have been reported have 
    been fixed. A small test case, if possible, greatly increases the chance 
    of reproducing the problem.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Displaying text labels, instance 
    names or master cell names is slow when there are large numbers of labels.</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is for the non-OpenGL version 
    - the problem is with Qt which has an accurate, but slow text rendering engine. 
    The OpenGL version uses vector fonts for text, which are implemented using 
    display lists and have negligible performance penalty.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Layout with complex polygons displays 
    slower in the OpenGL version.</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When using OpenGL, polygons need 
    to be tesselated in order to be rendered correctly. The tesselation is done 
    in software, and for polygons with a large number of vertices this can be 
    slow. The obvious workaround is to avoid complex polygons with zillions of 
    vertices - try converting them into trapezoids; you can use the Boolean operations 
    command for this.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I tried to run LVS but get an error.</font></h4>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You need to run extraction on a layout view before running LVS in order to identify devices (MOS, resistor etc) and generate connectivity info. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Can you read Calibre/Hercules/Assura/PVS DRC rules?</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, sorry, not directly. You may be able to translate rules into Glade's format, but there is no guarantee that all rules are supported. If there is a type of rule you need that is missing, let us know and it may be possible to implement it.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Do you support Cadence Skill / Cadence PCells?</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No, sorry, Skill is a Cadence proprietary language based on Lisp which was popular in the 1980's. Glade uses Python which is not proprietary and there are plenty of tools to help write and debug Python code. Cadence PCells can only be evaluated by Virtuoso, so they cannot be used outside the Cadence environment.</font>  </p>
